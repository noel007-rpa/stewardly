# Supabase Authentication
# Get these values from your Supabase project settings:
# 1. Go to https://app.supabase.com
# 2. Select your project
# 3. Go to Project Settings > API
# 4. Copy the Project URL and Publishable Key

# Project URL (unique to your project)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co

# Publishable Key (SAFE to expose in frontend code)
# - Located in Project Settings > API Keys > Publishable key
# - NOT the legacy "anon" key
# - NOT the "service_role" or "secret" key (those go server-side only)
# - Format: sb_publishable_xxxxxxxxxxxx
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=sb_publishable_xxxxxxxxxxxx

# Why Publishable Keys?
# ✅ Designed for frontend/SPA usage
# ✅ Scoped permissions via RLS policies
# ✅ Per-user data isolation through auth
# ✅ Safe to expose in browser and version control
# ✅ Modern Supabase recommended approach
#
# What NOT to use:
# ❌ Never use service_role or secret keys in frontend
# ❌ Avoid legacy "anon" keys (old projects)
# ❌ Never commit secret keys to version control
